RacketCon is a public meeting for everyone interested in Racket: developers, contributors, programmers, educators, and by-standers. It is an opportunity for all members of the community to come together to share plans, ideas, and enthusiasm. RacketCon will enable the entire Racket community to mingle: to update each other, to exchange ideas, to collaborate, and to help shape the future of Racket.
